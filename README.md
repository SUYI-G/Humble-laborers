# Humble-laborers
我们仨即将成为卑微打工人，这是我们为工作面试所做的部分准备工作。

首先是刷题。
题目来自https://programmercarl.com/ 。我们决定从2021.9.28开始每天做1题并上传。为了相互勉励、共同进步，我们约定截止到下次三方会面，做题最少的要掏三人份的奶茶钱。

所以，为了提升自己，为了更加光明的未来，最重要的是，为了免费奶茶，一起加油吧！


The three of us are going to be humble laborers. This is part of our preperation for the job interview.

First of all, we need a lot of practice.
Exercise problems are obtained from https://programmercarl.com/. We decided to complete one problem every day and upload the code starting from 2021.9.28. In order to encourage and improve ourselves, we have an agreement that the person who complete the least number of practice questions will pay for the milk tea for us three.

As a result, let's fight for self-improvements, for a brighter future and most importantly, for free milk tea!
